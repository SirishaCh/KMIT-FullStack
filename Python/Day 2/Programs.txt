Programs for the next week

Lists:
1. Swapping middle element with the previous element (i.e., middle-1)
Input: [12, 35, 9, 56, 24]
Output: [12, 9,35, 56, 24]
Input: [1, 2, 3]
Output: [2, 1,3]

2. Concatenate two lists in the following order
list1 = ["Hello ", "take "] 
list2 = ["Dear", "Sir"]
Expected Output:
['Hello Dear', 'Hello Sir', 'take Dear', 'take Sir']

3. Remove empty strings from the list of strings
list1 = ["Mike", "", "Emma", "Kelly", "", "Brad"]
Expected Output:
["Mike", "Emma", "Kelly", "Brad"]

For Loop:
1. Write a program to print the sum of the digits of a given number.  For example if the input is 123, the result should be 6. 

2. Given a number 'n', Program to check if it can be written as sum of first few prime numbers. Print ‘Yes’ if 'n' can be written as first few prime numbers and ‘No’ otherwise. 
For example, 
if n is 5 then print ‘Yes’ as it can be written as 2+3, 
if n is 41 then print ‘Yes’ as it can be written as 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 
if n is 11 then print 'No' as it cannot be written as sum of first few prime numbers.

3. Given a positive integer 'x' (with even number of digits in it), Program to compute the difference between  the sum of the digits occurring in the alternate positions (starting from the first position) and the sum of the digits occurring in the alternate positions, starting from the last rightmost position of 'x'

Sample Input: 8975.  
Sample Output: 1
Explanation:
The sum of the digits that occur in the alternate positions from the first position is 8+7=15.  
The sum of the digits that occur in the alternate positions, starting from the rightmost position is 5+9 = 14. 
Difference between the two sums is 1 (=15-14).  

4. Zack is given a math task by his teacher, where he is given 3 integers, say p,q and limit . He needs to raise the numbers such that p power a + q power b is less than or equal to limit.  And display the same.
Where a>=0 and b>=0
Input: p = 4, q = 2, limit = 10
Output: 2 3 5 6 8 9
Explanation: 
2 = 4 pow 0 + 2 pow 0
3 = 4 pow 0 + 2 pow 1
5 = 4 pow 1 + 2 pow 0
6 = 4 pow 1 + 2 pow 1
8 = 4 pow 1 + 2 pow 2
9 = 4 pow 0 + 2 pow 3

Sample Input2: p = 5, q = 3, limit= 15
Sample Output2: 2 4 6 8 10 14 
Note:
1 <= p <= 100
1 <= q <= 100
0 <= limit <= 10 pow 6
